# Project Summary

This unnamed piece of junk program is a short story-driven incremental game that you probably shouldn't play. The story, which is about person trying to make a lot of money -- is about as bad as the code, and there's no joy to have with either part. I am not usually this pessimistic, but this thing has been constantly putting me at my wits' end since I started it. So, I have about 2% love and 98% hate for it.

# User Guide

The program is quite simple and easy to wrap your head around. Here are some steps:

- Enter your name and click submit, or press enter. -- Choose wisely, because you can't change it afterwards, unless you reload the page.
- Once greeted with the worst UI you'll ever lay your eyes upon, feel free to read the story text, or start selling your rocks by pressing the sell button.
- To progress you have to press that button several times.
- When you've pressed it enough times, you'll get an option to progress to the next stage.
- Choose yes, and you get to choose between the legal or illegal route -- whatever you choose makes no difference, it's only story dependant, and even then it's minor.
- Choose no, and you stay at the current stage. But don't worry, you get the option to proceed to the next stage through a button.
- After choosing a route you just do the same thing again, but now your sell value will have increased and there's also a passive income now.
- Once you have done this for a while -- in this version until you reach $10,000, you'll get a pop-up saying you've won the game. Press "Ok", and the page reloads and you can indulge in this wonderful experience once again!
